    "# 1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store and manage data that is used by applications or websites. There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the Structured Query Language (SQL) and are organized using tables, columns, and rows. SQL databases are known for their consistency, reliability, and the ability to handle complex transactions. They are often used for applications that require a lot of data manipulation and analysis, such as financial systems and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are not based on a fixed schema and do not use SQL for querying data. Instead, NoSQL databases use different data models, such as document-based, key-value, or graph-based, to store data. NoSQL databases are known for their flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data. They are often used for applications that require a high level of scalability and performance, such as social media platforms and e-commerce websites."

    "# 2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of commonly used DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: This command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, the following SQL command creates a new table named \"customers\" with columns for customer ID, name, and email:\n",

    "    CREATE TABLE customers (\n",

    "        email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: This command is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table or index. For example, the following SQL command drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following SQL command adds a new column to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone_number VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all data from an existing table, while preserving the table structure. For example, the following SQL command removes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n"

    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of commonly used DML commands:\n",

    "    INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email, phone_number)\n",
    "    VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com', '555-1234');\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to retrieve data from a database. DQL commands are used to select and filter data from one or more tables in a database. The most commonly used DQL command is the SELECT statement, which retrieves data from a database. Other DQL commands include JOIN, which combines data from multiple tables, and UNION, which combines data from multiple SELECT statements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a table named \"employees\" with the following columns: employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, hire_date, and salary. To retrieve all data from this table, we would use the following SQL command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "To select specific columns, we can list them after the SELECT keyword, separated by commas. For example, the following SQL command selects only the employee ID, first name, and last name columns from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter the data based on certain criteria, we can use the WHERE clause. For example, the following SQL command selects only the employees whose salary is greater than 50000:\n",

    "# 5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary key and foreign key are two important concepts in relational database design, which are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It is used to ensure that each record in the table can be uniquely identified and accessed. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns, and it must have a unique value for each record in the table. Common examples of primary keys include social security numbers, email addresses, or customer IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables, where the values in the foreign key column in one table match the values in the primary key column in another table. This relationship allows data to be linked and retrieved from multiple tables. For example, in a database that stores orders and customers, the orders table may have a foreign key column that refers to the prima\n"

    "# 1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database management system. It stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format known as BSON (Binary JSON) which allows for easy scalability and high performance. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB does not rely on tables, rows, or columns. Instead, it stores data in documents, which can be grouped together in collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that don't use the traditional tabular structure of rows and columns to organize and store data. Instead, they use flexible data models that allow for more efficient handling of unstructured and semi-structured data. NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios where the data is highly variable or complex, and where the performance requirements are very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, such as in web applications that handle user-generated content, social media platforms, or IoT applications that generate a lot of sensor data. MongoDB's flexible data model allows for easy and efficient storage of this type of data, and its scalability makes it an excellent choice for handling large volumes of data. Additionally, MongoDB's support for replication and sharding makes it a highly available and fault-tolerant solution for large-scale data storage and processing.\n"

    "# 2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that offers a number of unique features that make it a popular choice for developers and organizations looking to manage large volumes of data. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Document-oriented data model: MongoDB is built around a flexible and highly scalable document-oriented data model. This allows developers to store data in a natural, JSON-like format, which can be easily queried, updated, and manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    High-performance indexing: MongoDB supports a wide range of indexing options, including single field, multi-key, and text indexes. This makes it easy to optimize queries and improve the performance of data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Horizontal scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, meaning that it can easily distribute data across multiple servers or nodes in a cluster. This allows organizations to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aggregation framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows developers to perform complex data analysis and processing tasks within the database itself. This can greatly improve performance and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the application and the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flexible data schema: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema for data. This allows developers to store data in a more flexible and natural format, which can greatly simplify development and make it easier to accommodate changes to the data over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Native support for replication and sharding: MongoDB includes native support for replication and sharding, which can greatly improve the availability and scalability of the database. Replication allows for automatic failover and recovery in the event of a node failure, while sharding allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes for improved performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a powerful and flexible database management system that offers a wide range of features to support the needs of modern applications and organizations. Its document-oriented data model, high-performance indexing, and horizontal scalability make it an excellent choice for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads, while its flexible schema and aggregation framework make it easy to work with and manipulate data in a variety of ways."

    "# 7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, there are three methods that can be used to remove documents or collections from a database: delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop().\n",
    "\n",
    "The delete_one() method is used to remove a single document from a collection that matches a specified filter. This method will remove the first document that matches the filter, if there are multiple matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "The delete_many() method is used to remove multiple documents from a collection that match a specified filter. This method will remove all documents that match the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}})\n",
    "    \n",
    "The drop() method is used to remove an entire collection from a database. This method takes no arguments and simply removes the entire collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    collection.drop()\n",
    "\n",
    "Both delete_one() and delete_many() methods take a filter object as an argument, which is a dictionary that specifies the criteria for selecting the documents to remove.\n",
    "In general, delete_one() and delete_many() methods are used when you want to selectively remove documents from a collection based on specific criteria, while the drop() method is used when you want to remove an entire collection."

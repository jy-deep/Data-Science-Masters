    "1. Training Set:\n",
    "   - Purpose: The training set is the subset of data used to train or fit the model. It consists of input data and their corresponding output labels (in supervised learning) or unlabeled examples (in unsupervised learning).\n",
    "   - Importance: The training set is crucial for the model to learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. It allows the model to adjust its parameters or weights based on the provided examples, enabling it to make accurate predictions or perform desired tasks.\n",

    "2. Test Set:\n",
    "   - Purpose: The test set is a separate subset of data that is not used during the training phase. It serves as an independent dataset to evaluate the model's performance and measure its generalization ability on unseen data.\n",
    "   - Importance: The test set provides an unbiased assessment of the model's performance on new, unseen data. It helps to estimate how well the model is likely to perform in real-world scenarios and enables comparison between different models or techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Validation Set:\n",
    "   - Purpose: The validation set is another independent subset of data that is used to fine-tune the model during the training phase. It helps in selecting the best hyperparameters, tuning the model's architecture, or making early stopping decisions.\n",
    "   - Importance: The validation set allows for model selection and hyperparameter tuning, helping to optimize the model's performance. By evaluating the model on the validation set, one can make informed decisions regarding model adjustments, regularization techniques, or feature engineering, ultimately improving the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of these splits lies in assessing and improving the performance and generalization capability of a machine learning model. By using separate subsets for training, testing, and validation, it helps to detect issues such as overfitting (model performs well on training data but poorly on new data) and allows for model optimization and selection. Additionally, it helps in estimating the model's performance on unseen data, providing confidence in its reliability and applicability."

    "Unsupervised learning can be effectively used in anomaly detection, as it allows for the discovery of patterns or structures in the data without the need for labeled examples of anomalies. Here are a few approaches in unsupervised learning commonly used for anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Density-Based Approaches:\n",
    "   - Density-based methods, such as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), can be used for anomaly detection. These algorithms identify regions of higher density in the data and classify data points outside those regions as anomalies.\n",

    "   - Clustering algorithms, such as k-means clustering or Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), can be utilized for anomaly detection. Anomalies are often data points that do not belong to any specific cluster or form separate clusters themselves.\n",
    "   - By clustering the data and identifying data points that do not fit well within any cluster, it is possible to identify potential anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Autoencoders:\n",
    "   - Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct their input data. Anomalies are likely to be significantly different from normal data and can result in poor reconstruction quality.\n",
    "   - By training an autoencoder on normal data and then using it to reconstruct new data, large discrepancies between the input and reconstructed data can indicate the presence of anomalies.\n",

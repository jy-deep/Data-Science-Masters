    "1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that are common to all objects of that class. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class, and it has its own set of values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",

    "2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation: This refers to the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. The data is kept private within the class and can only be accessed and modified through the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance: This is the mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another class. Inheritance allows for the creation of new classes that reuse the properties and methods of existing classes, thereby promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading allows for the creation of multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: This is the practice of hiding complex details and providing a simplified interface for interacting with a system. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces, which define the common properties and methods of a group of related classes without specifying their implementation details. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity, improve modularity, and promote maintainability."

    "3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Answer:\n",

    "Answer:\n",

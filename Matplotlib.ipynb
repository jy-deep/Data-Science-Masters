    "# 1: What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name five plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of options for creating visualizations and can be used in various scientific, engineering, and data analysis applications. Matplotlib is open-source and can be used freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is used for creating different types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histogram plots, and pie charts. It allows users to customize plots with various formatting options, including colors, labels, markers, and fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pyplot module of Matplotlib is used for creating simple plots and visualizations quickly. Some of the plots that can be plotted using Pyplot module of Matplotlib are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Line plot: A line plot is used to visualize the relationship between two variables. It is created by plotting a series of data points on a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scatter plot: A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two variables. It is created by plotting individual data points on a two-dimensional plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bar plot: A bar plot is used to visualize the distribution of categorical data. It is created by plotting bars of different heights that represent the frequency or proportion of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Histogram plot: A histogram plot is used to visualize the distribution of continuous data. It is created by dividing the range of data into equal intervals and plotting the frequency or proportion of data points in each interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pie chart: A pie chart is used to visualize the relative proportion of different categories in a dataset. It is created by dividing a circle into slices that represent the proportion of each category."

    "The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency used to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. Here are the main differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values. It is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values in the dataset. The mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that extreme values can have a large impact on the final value.\n",

    "    Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are ordered from lowest to highest. If there is an even number of values, then the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is not affected by outliers, making it a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean.\n",

    "Each of these measures can provide a different perspective on the central tendency of a dataset, and they may be used together or separately depending on the nature of the data and the questions being asked. The choice of which measure to use will depend on factors such as the distribution of the data, the presence of outliers, and the purpose of the analysis."

    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread of a dataset by measuring how much the data points deviate from the central tendency. They provide information on the variability or spread of the data and help to understand how far the values in a dataset are from the central point.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Range: It is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset. It gives an idea about how much the data is spread out. A larger range indicates a larger spread, whereas a smaller range indicates a smaller spread. However, it can be affected by extreme values or outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variance: It is the average of the squared differences from the mean. It gives an idea of how much the data points are spread out from the mean. A larger variance indicates a larger spread, whereas a smaller variance indicates a smaller spread.\n",

    "    Standard deviation: It is the square root of the variance. It measures how much the data is dispersed or spread out from the mean. A larger standard deviation indicates a larger spread, whereas a smaller standard deviation indicates a smaller spread.\n",

Then, we calculate the difference between each data point and the mean, square them, and take the average. The variance of the dataset is (70 - 80)^2 + (75 - 80)^2 + (80 - 80)^2 + (85 - 80)^2 + (90 - 80)^2 / 5 = 100.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution. In statistics, it refers to the degree to which a distribution is skewed or lopsided, i.e., it measures the extent to which the data is not symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a distribution is symmetric, it has zero skewness. A positive skewness value indicates that the distribution has a tail that extends to the right, or positive side, of the distribution, and that the majority of the data is concentrated on the left or negative side. In contrast, a negative skewness value indicates that the distribution has a tail that extends to the left, or negative side, of the distribution, and that the majority of the data is concentrated on the right or positive side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can affect statistical analysis and interpretation of results. For example, if the data is positively skewed, the mean is likely to be greater than the median, which can lead to an overestimation of the central tendency of the data. Conversely, if the data is negatively skewed, the mean is likely to be less than the median, which can lead to an underestimation of the central tendency."

    "# 10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation are both measures of the relationship between two variables, but they differ in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of how two variables change together. It is a measure of the extent to which two variables are linearly related to each other. Specifically, covariance measures the joint variability of two random variables. It is calculated by taking the product of the deviations of each variable from its respective mean, and then averaging those products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a normalized version of covariance. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while taking into account the units of measurement. It is calculated by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables. The resulting value ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no correlation and values closer to -1 or 1 indicating stronger correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between covariance and correlation is that covariance is sensitive to changes in scale, while correlation is not. That is, the magnitude of covariance depends on the units of measurement, while correlation does not. This makes correlation a more useful measure for comparing the strength of the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both covariance and correlation are used in statistical analysis to understand the relationship between two variables. Covariance can be used to determine whether two variables tend to move in the same direction or in opposite directions, while correlation can be used to determine the strength and direction of the relationship. These measures are often used in regression analysis, where the goal is to predict one variable based on the other. They are also used in data exploration and visualization, to identify patterns and relationships in the data."

    "    Interpretation: Covariance can be difficult to interpret because its value depends on the scale of the variables being measured. A positive covariance means that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance means that one variable tends to increase as the other decreases. However, it is difficult to say how strong or weak the relationship is based solely on the covariance value. On the other hand, correlation is easier to interpret because it is standardized and always falls between -1 and 1.

The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, can be inflated by the presence of outliers.

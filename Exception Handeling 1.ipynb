    "# 1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "ANSWERS \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an Exception occurs, the interpreter raises an object, which contains information about the error, such as its type and a message that describes the error. The program can then catch and handle the Exception appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter encounters an incorrect syntax in the code. For example, a syntax error can occur when a programmer forgets to close a parenthesis, uses an incorrect indentation, or misspells a keyword. Syntax errors prevent the interpreter from executing the program and must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur during the compilation stage of the program, while Exceptions occur during the runtime of the program. Syntax errors are typically easier to detect and fix, as they usually result in a clear error message that points to the exact location of the error in the code. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be more challenging to diagnose, as they can be caused by a wide range of issues, including invalid inputs, incorrect function calls, or unexpected events during program execution. It is essential to handle Exceptions properly to ensure that the program can recover gracefully from errors and continue running.\n"

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",

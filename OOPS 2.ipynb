    "# 1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. The open() function returns a file object that can be used to read from or write to the file, depending on the mode in which the file is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two parameters: the file name (a string) and the mode in which to open the file (also a string). The mode specifies how the file should be opened, whether it should be read or written, and whether the file should be created if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"r\": This mode is used for reading files. If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"w\": This mode is used for writing to files. If the file exists, it will overwrite the file contents. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"a\": This mode is used for appending to files. If the file exists, the new data will be added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"x\": This mode is used to create a new file for writing, but will raise a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"b\": This mode is used for opening binary files (e.g. image or audio files). This mode can be combined with any of the above modes by adding a b to the end of the mode string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"t\": This mode is used for opening text files (default mode). This mode can be combined with any of the above modes by adding a t to the end of the mode string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to open a file named \"example.txt\" for reading, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_object = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To open the same file for writing, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_object = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To open the file for appending, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_object = open(\"example.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a binary file for reading, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_object = open(\"example.bin\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a text file for writing, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_object = open(\"example.txt\", \"wt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember to close the file using the close() method of the file object after reading from or writing to the file."

    "# 2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close a file that was previously opened using the open() function. It's important to close a file after reading from or writing to it because it frees up system resources that were used to keep the file open. If a large number of files are left open, it can lead to a shortage of system resources, which can cause other parts of the program to slow down or even crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened using the open() function, the operating system creates a file object that is used to manage the connection between the program and the file on disk. This file object is kept in memory until the program explicitly closes the file using the close() function. If the file is not closed, the file object remains in memory and continues to consume system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also ensures that any changes made to the file are written to disk. When a file is written to, the operating system typically stores the changes in a buffer in memory rather than immediately writing them to disk. If the file is not closed properly, the changes in the buffer may not be written to disk, leading to data loss or corruption."

    "# 4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several ways to read the contents of a file once it has been opened using the open() function. The three most common methods for reading file contents are read(), readline(), and readlines().\n",
    "\n",
    "i. read() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The read() method reads the entire contents of a file and returns it as a single string. It takes an optional argument that specifies the maximum number of bytes to read. If no argument is specified, it reads the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open the file for reading\n",
    "    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",

    "    file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Print the contents of the file\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. readline() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The readline() method reads a single line from a file and returns it as a string. Each time it is called, it reads the next line of the file.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Print the line that was read\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "\n",

    "# 5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the with statement is used in conjunction with the open() function to automatically handle the opening and closing of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using with statement with open(), the file is automatically closed once the block of code inside the with statement has completed. This ensures that the file is closed even if an exception is raised within the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates how to use with statement with open():\n",

    "#### Open a file named \"example.txt\" for reading using with statement\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Print the contents of the file\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using with statement with open() is that it ensures that the file is always properly closed, regardless of what happens in the block of code. This helps to prevent resource leaks and ensures that your program is more robust and reliable."

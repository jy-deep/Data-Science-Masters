    "The characteristics of tuples are:\n",
    "    1. Tuples are written with round brackets or parentheses.\n",
    "    2. Tuples can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats, other tuples, etc.).\n",
    "    3. Tuples are ordered, which means that the elements have a specific position or index within the tuple.\n",
    "    4. Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements. However, you can create a new tuple by concatenating or slicing existing tuples.\n",

    "Yes, tuples in Python are immutable. Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements. This means that you cannot add, remove, or change items in a tuple. However, you can create a new tuple by concatenating or slicing existing tuples."

    "# 2: What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why tuples have only two in built methods as compared to lists.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, tuples are a built-in data type and they come with two default methods:\n",
    "    1.count(): The count() method takes a single argument, which is the element to be counted. It returns an integer that represents the number of times that element appears in the tuple. For example: \n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    count_one = my_tuple.count(1)\n",
    "    print(count_one) # Output: 3\n",
    "    2.index(): The index() method takes a single argument, which is the element to be searched. It returns the index of the first occurrence of that element in the tuple. If the element is not found, it raises a ValueError exception. For example: \n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    index_two = my_tuple.index(2)\n",
    "    print(index_two) # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have only two built-in methods as compared to lists because tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, they cannot be modified. Therefore, they do not require as many built-in methods as lists, which are mutable data structures and can be modified dynamically."

    "# 4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, a DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure that can store data of different types, such as numeric, string, and Boolean. It is similar to a table in a relational database or a spreadsheet in a Microsoft Excel file, where each row represents a separate observation or record, and each column represents a separate variable or feature. A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Pandas Series, where each Series represents a column of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of any type, such as integer, float, string, and Boolean. It can be thought of as a single column of a DataFrame or a single variable in a dataset.\n",

    "# 5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous functions and methods available in Pandas that can be used to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Some common functions and methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    head(n): Returns the first n rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "    tail(n): Returns the last n rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "    info(): Displays information about the DataFrame, such as the number of rows and columns, column data types, and memory usage.\n",
    "    describe(): Computes basic summary statistics for each column, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.\n",
    "    drop(columns=cols): Removes one or more columns from the DataFrame.\n",
    "    dropna(): Removes rows with missing values.\n",
    "    fillna(value): Fills in missing values with a specified value.\n",
    "    groupby(col): Groups the DataFrame by a specified column and returns a GroupBy object, which can be used to perform aggregate operations such as mean, sum, and count on each group.\n",
    "    sort_values(by=col): Sorts the DataFrame by a specified column in ascending order.\n",
    "    pivot_table(values, index, columns): Creates a pivot table that summarizes the data in the DataFrame by aggregating values based on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of when you might use the groupby() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a DataFrame containing data on the sales of different products in different regions, and you want to calculate the total sales for each product across all regions. You can use the groupby() function to group the data by the Product column and then apply the sum() function to the Sales column to get the total sales for each product:\n",

    "# 6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",

    "The Pandas Series and DataFrame are mutable in nature, while the Panel is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it is possible to modify the contents of a Series or a DataFrame after it has been created by adding, removing, or updating values. However, it is not possible to modify the contents of a Panel after it has been created. Instead, a new Panel must be created if any changes need to be made.\n",

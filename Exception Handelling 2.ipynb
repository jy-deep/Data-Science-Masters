    "# 1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why the BaseException class is used as the base class for custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Standardization: By extending the BaseException class, the custom exception class conforms to the standard Python exception hierarchy. This makes it easier to understand and manage the exceptions thrown by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exception handling: The BaseException class provides a consistent interface for handling exceptions. This allows developers to catch and handle custom exceptions in the same way as built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Customization: By extending the BaseException class, developers can customize the behavior of the exception to suit their needs. For example, they can define custom error messages, define additional attributes, or override methods to provide additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compatibility: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that type checking is done at runtime. By extending the BaseException class, custom exceptions can be used interchangeably with built-in exceptions in many cases, making the code more flexible and maintainable.\n"

    "# 3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python, the ArithmeticError class is a built-in exception class that represents errors that occur during arithmetic operations. This class is a subclass of the Exception class, which is the base class for all exceptions in Python.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "The LookupError class is a built-in exception class in Python that serves as the base class for exceptions that occur when a lookup fails. This class is a subclass of the Exception class, which is the base class for all exceptions in Python.\n",

    "# 5. Explain ImportError.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",

    "ImportError is a built-in Python exception that occurs when an imported module or package cannot be found or loaded. This error can occur due to several reasons, such as a misspelled module name, a missing module or package, or a circular import.\n",

    "# 6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use specific exception classes: Use specific exception classes to catch only the errors that you expect, rather than catching all exceptions using the generic except clause. This makes the code more readable and helps to debug issues more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keep try blocks minimal: Keep the try blocks as minimal as possible and move the code that can raise an exception inside the try block. This helps to localize the code that can cause an exception and reduces the chance of catching unrelated exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use finally to perform cleanup: Use finally block to ensure that the resources are released properly, even if an exception is raised. This helps to prevent resource leaks and ensures that the program terminates gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Avoid bare except: Avoid using bare except clauses as they catch all types of exceptions, including system errors, which can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior. Instead, catch only the specific exceptions that you expect to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Log the exception: Use the logging module to log the exception messages along with the context information such as file name, line number, and function name. This helps in debugging the issue and identifying the root cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reraise the exception: Reraise the exception after logging or handling it, if it cannot be handled at the current level. This helps to propagate the exception up the call stack and allows for higher-level exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use context managers: Use context managers (with statements) to ensure that resources are properly acquired and released. This helps to prevent resource leaks and ensures that the program behaves correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust and maintainable Python code that handles exceptions gracefully and prevents unexpected behavior."
